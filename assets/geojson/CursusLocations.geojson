It extends at least 101m on an east/west axis. A central pathway formed by two parallel pit/post alignments runs from the entrance causeway for the full length of the enclosed space. These lines of pit/posts are 3–4m apart and each pit is 1.5–2m in diameter. Either side of the central pathway is a further alignment of larger pits each 2–4m in diameter and 2.5–4m apart. The site is located 215m south of Newgrange passage tomb (ME019-045---) and within the core area of Brú na Bóinne World Heritage Site. It is situated on the highest, fluvio-glacial terrace above the River Boyne east of Newgrange Farm and 400m north-west of the satellite passage tomb known as ‘Site A’ (ME019-049001-).\nIn 2018 a Royal Irish Academy funded excavation (18E0369) by Geraldine Stout cut a trench (2m by 25m) across a section of the northern half of the site. The excavation confirmed the sub-surface presence of the three key features that had been identified in the geophysical survey; two outer ditches (with an associated levelled bank), four rows of internal pits, and an axial mound at the centre. A charcoal sample from the basal fill of the outer ditch fill produced a C14 date of 2632–2472 BC (calibrated, 95.4 % probability, appendix 4). This layer also produced a chert platform core.\nOne of the larger  pits (diam. 4.80m; D 1.65m) produced evidence for  burnt animal deposits that were identified as cattle and possible pig, and charred remains of willow and alder in the upper fill. Charcoal samples from the pits and ditches consisted almost entirely of oak; the remains of heartwood from mature trees growing in open clearings. They were free of any insect remains or fungal growth which suggests that the trees were felled and used as green wood, or if seasoned were kept in dry storage.  \nA preliminary inspection of the flints by Dr Conor Brady has identified 36 flint artefacts, three chert artefacts and one siliceous artefact. Much of the flint, which was recovered largely from the topsoil, is debitage and includes many platform flakes, flake fragments and chunks. Two pieces of flint are burnt and many are patinated, indicating recycling. The artefacts identified include a chert platform core, a possible bipolar core, a scraper fragment and a possible broken barbed and tanged arrowhead.\n\nDate of upload: 19 November 2018"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-7.556478061948566,52.42704847947505]},"properties":{"ENTITY_ID":"TS05636","SMRS":"TS078-078----","COUNTY":"TIPPERARY SOUTH","TOWNLAND":"BALLYPATRICK (Temple-etney Par.),TOOR (Kilcash Par.)","ZONE_ID":"R184390","MONUMENT_CLASS":"Cursus","WEBSITE_LINK":"https://heritagedata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0c9eb9575b544081b0d296436d8f60f8&query=18a4b61b268-layer-9%2CSMRS%2CTS078-078----","WEB_NOTES":"On the E mountain slope of Slievenamon.
